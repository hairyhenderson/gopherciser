# Extending Gopherciser

Gopherciser can be extended without having to alter its base code.

## Adding support for extensions and overriding settings for default objects

Gopherciser supports configuring how to get data and make selections in standard Qlik SenseÂ® objects. The file can be extended with functionality for custom objects. For more information, see [Supporting extensions and overriding defaults](./sense-object-definitions.md).
